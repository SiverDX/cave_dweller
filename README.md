# To Consider
## Bugs
* Rails / half blocks cause problems with squeezing
* Hitbox too small
* It sometimes moves while being looked at

## Ideas
* Add chance to flee when its on fire
* Extinguish light sources in a certain radius around the mob
* More configs
  * Modify action chance (when staring timer is finished)
  * Disable mounting behaviour (e.g. being placed in a boat)
* Teleport to a free location if it gets stuck / takes suffocation damage
* Trigger chase as retaliation
