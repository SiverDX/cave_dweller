* You will need to rename `assets\cavenoise` to `assets\cave_dweller`
* Delete everything except the `geo` and `textures` directories

# To Consider
## General
* Split up config a bit

## Bugs
* Rails / half blocks cause problems with squeezing
* Hitbox too small

## Ideas
* Add chance to flee when its on fire
* Extinguish light sources in a certain radius around the mob
* More configs
  * Modify action chance (when staring timer is finished)
* Teleport to a free location if it gets stuck / takes suffocation damage
* Trigger chase as retaliation
