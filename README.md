* Cave Dweller has depth strider
* Configs (spawn timer, attributes, some behaviour parts, etc.)

# Installation
Requires GeckoLib: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib/files?version=1.19.2&gameVersionTypeId=1

# Other
Recommend using https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/creepier-cave-dwellers
* You will need to rename `assets\cavenoise` to `assets\cave_dweller`
* Delete everything except the `geo` and `textures` directories

# To Consider
## Bugs
* Rails / half blocks break squeezing
* Hitbox too small
* It sometimes moves (stroll goal?) while being looked at
* 1.19.2 - 1.20 logic ticks twice (START and END phase) (affects spawn and noise timers)

## Ideas
* Add chance to flee when its on fire
* Extinguish light sources in a certain radius around the mob
* More configs
  * Disable climbing
  * Modify action chance (when staring timer is finished)
* Break down doors
