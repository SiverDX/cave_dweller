# Need to fix
- If the Cave Dweller would need to crawl but it's facing the player through a corner (which contains no solid block) it won't crawl
- Sometimes gets stuck in walls for a bit
- Animations
- Reduce the amount of blockstate gets
- Stroll goal also uses crawling - not sure if this should be kept
  - Looks kinda weird but also allows it to naturally escape cages when not aggressive

# Ideas
- Add chance to flee when its on fire
- Extinguish light sources in a certain radius around the mob
- Trigger chase as retaliation
